      <h2> Synopsis </h2>
      <p>Brooklyn teenager, Miles Morales, juggles adjusting and fitting in at his new rich-kid boarding school and struggling to live up to his fathers’ exceptions, all while trying to navigate and understand his new-found spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. After witnessing the death of New York’s favourite hero, Spider-Man (Peter Parker), the film’s story follows Miles Morales as he takes on the responsibility of protecting the city and becoming New York’s new superhero, to honour Spider-Man’s legacy. To save the city from Kingpin and his “Super-Collider”, Miles joins other spider-like individuals from various parallel universes in the multiverse called the “Spider-Verse” to stop the threat from all alternate realities. With their help Miles uncovers his true abilities and is able to create a new drive to destroy the “Super-Collider”, as he accidentally damaged the one Spider-Man gave him.</p>
